                    † For purposes of these Rewards Program Terms and Conditions, “merchant” shall refer to a retailer, business or any other place where you make an eligible purchase. Each merchant is assigned a Merchant Category Code (“MCC”) that indicates the merchant's area of business. For example, hotels are generally assigned a specific MCC. We use MCCs to determine whether eligible purchases qualify for 2 Miles for each $1.00 spent. We do not assign or have any control over which MCC is assigned to a given merchant; the MCCs are chosen and assigned by a third party and that third party may change the MCCs from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we are provided the MCC for that merchant at the time of the transaction. If the MCC matches a category that gives you 2 Miles for each$1.00 spent - for example, if the MCC tells us that you made a purchase at a hotel - you will receive 2 Miles for each $1.00 spent for that purchase. You may believe that a purchase at a given merchant qualifies for 2 Miles, but we rely on the MCC applied to the merchant to make that determination. For example, if you eat at a restaurant within a hotel, it may be assigned a “restaurant” MCC, which will not earn 2 Miles for each $1.00 spent.

There is no limit to the amount of Miles you can earn.Note: We may feature special Miles promotional offers from time to time.
