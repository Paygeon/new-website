                            <p>Paygeon is a financial technology company, not a bank. The Paygeon® Visa® Corporate Card is issued by Pathward, N.A. pursuant to a license by Visa USA and can be used anywhere Visa is accepted.</p>
                            <p>† For purposes of these Rewards Program Terms and Conditions, “merchant” shall refer to a retailer, business, or any other place where you make an eligible purchase. Each merchant is assigned a Merchant Category Code (“MCC”) that indicates the merchant's area of business. We use MCCs to determine whether eligible purchases qualify for 2 Miles for each $1.00 spent. We do not assign or have any control over which MCC is assigned to a given merchant; the MCCs are chosen and assigned by a third party, and that third party may change the MCCs from time to time. When you make a purchase at a merchant, we are provided the MCC for that merchant at the time of the transaction. If the MCC matches a category that gives you 2 Miles for each $1.00 spent - for example, if the MCC tells us that you made a purchase at a hotel - you will receive 2 Miles for each $1.00 spent for that purchase. You may believe that a purchase at a given merchant qualifies for 2 Miles, but we rely on the MCC applied to the merchant to make that determination. For example, if you eat at a restaurant within a hotel, it may be assigned a “restaurant” MCC, which will not earn 2 Miles for each $1.00 spent.</p>
                            <s>1 Mile for each $1.00 spent on all eligible purchases</s>
                            <p>You will earn one (1) Mile for each $1.00 in eligible purchases. There is no limit to the amount of Miles you can earn.</p>
                            <s>2 Miles for each $1.00 spent on eligible airline ticket, car rental, or hotel lodging purchases</s>
                            <p>You will earn two (2) Miles for each $1.00 in eligible purchases on airline tickets, car rentals, or hotel lodging. Non-airline ticket purchases, such as seat upgrades, baggage fees, and onboard amenities, as well as non-lodging purchases made at a hotel, such as dining and activities, will not earn 2 Miles for each $1.00 in eligible purchases but are eligible to earn 1 Mile for each $1.00 in eligible purchases. There is no limit to the amount of Miles you can earn. Note: We may feature special Miles promotional offers from time to time. The terms of those offers will be disclosed to you when they are available.</p>

Paygeon does not guarantee that applications will be processed and submitted before PPP funds are no longer available.
