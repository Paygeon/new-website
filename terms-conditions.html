                                <p>1. The Paygeon Platform&#8205;<br> 
                                
                                1.1 Services<br> 
                                
                                The Services allow you to issue and manage Cards for your Users; access other Payment Services; manage and control spending; view and customize reporting; access, use, and connect to Third-Party Services through your Paygeon Account; and, subject to the applicable Paygeon Terms and any other related supplements or addenda hereto, access other optional services through your Paygeon Account.

Some Services may be delivered or supported by specific Paygeon affiliates, Third-Party Service Providers and Financial Institution Partners and may require your agreement to Supplemental Terms.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>1.2. Opening a Paygeon Account<br> 
                                
                                You will need to provide Company Data and Personal Data and connect at least one Linked Account when submitting an application for a Paygeon Account. Such Company Data may include business information (such as registered business name and state of incorporation for Company, the business address, ownership details, actual or anticipated revenue, the nature of the business, and details from Linked Accounts and other business information we may request from time to time), and such Personal Data may include the name, contact information, date of birth and other identifying information of Users, beneficial owners and other relevant Company personnel at the sole discretion of Paygeon and its affiliates. You may also need to provide documentary information used to verify such Company Data and Personal Data (such as corporate registration certificate, proof of address, or personal identification). Use of specific Services or features may also require that you permit Paygeon to access Company Data and Personal Data through Third-Party Services. You may change Linked Accounts through your Paygeon Account.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>We provide Company Data and Personal Data to Financial Institution Partners and Third-Party Service Providers to determine your eligibility for Services and Cards. We, Financial Institution Partners and Third-Party Service Providers may approve or deny your application(s) or grant you provisional access to the Services, Third-Party Services or your Paygeon Account while your application is pending additional review. Paygeon, Financial Institution Partners and Third-Party Service Providers rely on the accuracy of all such Company Data and Personal Data when opening, maintaining and using your Paygeon Account. We may deny applications, interrupt provision of the Services to you, or suspend or close your Paygeon Account for any reason, with or without prior Notice, including where required Company Data or Personal Data is incomplete, inaccurate or out of date. You represent and warrant that you will keep all such Company Data and Personal Data current, complete and accurate in your Paygeon Account whether we provide you with full or provisional access, by contacting Paygeon and providing any updated Company Data or Personal Data. We may request information from credit reporting agencies using the Company Data and Personal Data you have provided, and may report the performance of your account to one or more credit reporting agencies. We may also require additional information from you at any time.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>If your business was referred to Paygeon, you acknowledge and agree that Paygeon may provide the status of your application and limited Company Data about you to the Paygeon customer or partner that referred you, which may include (a) notice that you successfully opened a Paygeon Account and/or met other criteria required by the referral link or other referral method, such as completing a minimum required payment; or (b) aggregate spend data or total spend volumes as required to determine partner incentives.</p>

                                Some Services may have associated transaction, finance or other Fees, which Paygeon will disclose in advance of charging. Disclosure may be provided in this Agreement (including any applicable addenda), by Notice or prior to affirmative agreement through the Services.</p>

You are responsible for any actions or failure to act on the part of Administrators, Users, and those using credentials issued to Administrators or Users to access Company's Paygeon Account.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>All potential Users will be required to accept User Terms posted at https://www.Paygeon.com/legal in order to become Users, and all Users that are authorized to use Cards or other payment tools may also be required to accept terms presented or required by Financial Institution Partners or Paygeon affiliates. You represent and warrant that each User enters into and complies in all respects with the User Terms.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>1.5. Security and Monitoring your Paygeon Account<br> 
                                
                                You will keep your Paygeon Account secure and only provide access to individuals that you have authorized. You will immediately disable User access to the Services if you know or believe your Paygeon Account has or may have been compromised or has been or may be misused; and you will promptly notify us (via the Services or by contacting our support team) of any known or reasonably suspected unauthorized access or use.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>1.6. Authorized Users<br> 
                                
                                You will authorize Users, which will allow them to use the Services and access certain functionality of your Paygeon Account. You are responsible for ensuring that Users are aware of and comply with your obligations under this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 1.7 (Requirements and Prohibited Activity). You are responsible for obtaining consent from your Users to enable Paygeon and Financial Institution Partners to collect, use, retain, and disclose Personal Data, and for ensuring that Users have read and agreed to the Privacy Policy and all applicable terms.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>You are responsible for notifying Users of and administering your corporate expense and spend management policies and resolving any disputes relating to your maintenance or administration of such policies, including when you elect to use the Services to request or receive reimbursements from User accounts. You must ensure that your Users are aware of and abide by all applicable Paygeon Terms.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>1.7. Requirements and Prohibited Activities<br> 
                                
                                Only United States Entities may apply for a Paygeon Account. Companies registered outside the United States, as well as consumers, sole proprietors and unincorporated partnerships, are not permitted to use, or attempt to open or use, a Paygeon Account. Foreign offices or affiliates of United States Entities, and Users based at such foreign offices, may use the Services and be issued Cards subject to any requirements imposed by Paygeon and the applicable Financial Institution Partner, and you remain fully responsible for all use of the Services and compliance with this Agreement. Paygeon may in its sole discretion decline to provide cashback reward credits based on any foreign transactions.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Your Paygeon Account, Services, and Cards may only be used for the Company's bona fide business expenses. Your Paygeon Account, Services, and Cards may not be (a) used for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by this Platform Agreement or the Card Terms; (b) used for any personal, family, or household use; (c) provided to or used for the benefit of an individual, organization, or country that is blocked or sanctioned by the United States, including those identified by the United States Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC); (d) used by unaffiliated third parties; or (e) used for any other activities not for the benefit of the Company.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>We will not approve and may close Paygeon Accounts that we know or believe are engaged in any of the prohibited activities identified in the Prohibited Activities List, or any other restricted category as determined by Paygeon or any Financial Institution Partner in their sole discretion. Where Company is engaged in certain restricted activities, Paygeon may require that you provide additional information to open or maintain your Paygeon Account. We may update the list of prohibited or restricted activities at any time and from time to time. You agree to review this regularly and contact us with any questions you have about how this list may apply to Company's business.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>We may suspend or terminate access to your Paygeon Account, Services or Cards if we believe in our sole discretion that this section was violated, if required by a Financial Institution Partner, if we believe you are engaged in fraudulent activities or creating an undue risk to us or others, or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. Without limiting any of your indemnification or other obligations to us, you agree to pay all Fines imposed on Paygeon or any affiliate, officer, employee, agent or representative thereof by Financial Institution Partners, regulators, or government agencies for your violation of this section.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>1.8. Identification as Customer<br> 
                                
                                We may publicly reference you as a Paygeon customer on our website or in communications during the term of this Platform Agreement. We will not express any false endorsement or partnerships. You grant Paygeon a limited license to use Company trademarks or service marks for this purpose. Please notify us if you prefer that we not identify you as a Paygeon customer and we will use best efforts to remove references to you on our website or in communications.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>1.9. Ownership and License<br> 
                                
                                As between you and Paygeon, Paygeon and licensors own all Paygeon Property, including all modifications, improvements, enhancements, derivative works, models or features. You, Administrators, and Users may use Paygeon Property only as and for the purposes provided in this Platform Agreement and the Card Terms. You may not modify, reverse engineer, create derivative works from, or disassemble Paygeon Property; or register, attempt to register, or claim ownership in Paygeon Property or portions of Paygeon Property.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Paygeon grants you a nonexclusive and nontransferable license to use Paygeon Property as permitted by this Platform Agreement to the extent that Paygeon provides it to you via the Services. This license terminates upon termination of this Platform Agreement unless terminated earlier by us.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>1.10. Data and Privacy<br> 
                                
                                You acknowledge, understand and agree that the Card Networks, Paygeon, and Financial Institution Partners collect, process and share Company Data and Personal Data through your use of the Cards, the Services (including received through Linked Accounts), and Third-Party Services. We may use and disclose Company Data and Personal Data (a) to provide and improve Services; (b) as required by law, Financial Institution Partners or Card Network rules; (c) for underwriting, identity verification, and fraud or loss prevention; (d) to verify account balances and account information, establish and adjust spending limits, and identify spending patterns; (e) to analyze and report transactions; (f) to report Company performance to credit reporting agencies and credit rating agencies, where appropriate (g) for internal analytics and reporting; and (h) as needed in dispute resolution.</p>

                                Paygeon may determine when, how, and under what conditions Company or Users may qualify for or earn rewards. Rewards are subject to the Paygeon Rewards Terms and this Platform Agreement. Certain Cards or transactions may not be eligible for some or any rewards, including cashback reward credits. Rewards may also be subject to limits, revocation, or forfeiture as set forth in the Paygeon Rewards Terms. Any right to rewards or benefits shall terminate upon the termination of this Agreement, the closure of your Paygeon Account, or in the event of any breach of this Agreement. Certain rewards or benefits may be subject to additional agreements or disclosures.</p>

                                Paygeon may make Beta Services available to you, which may be subject to additional terms and conditions. You acknowledge that Beta Services may be unstable and subject to frequent, substantial interruptions and to erroneous output and operation.

                                Company hereby grants Paygeon a royalty-free, fully-paid, irrevocable, perpetual, nonexclusive, worldwide, assignable and otherwise transferrable license, with the unrestricted and unlimited right to grant sublicenses, (1) to create derivative works based upon any Feedback and (2) to use, copy, display, publish, distribute or otherwise commercialize or exploit in any manner any Feedback or derivative works based thereon.

                                Payment Services may be provided by (a) applicable Financial Institution Partners through Paygeon Business Corporation; and/or (b) Paygeon Payments Corporation, a licensed money transmitter or its statutory equivalent in applicable U.S. jurisdictions. The Payments Entity Schedule indicates whether applicable Financial Institution Partners together with Paygeon Business Corporation, or Paygeon Payments Corporation, is providing Payment Services to you. We may update the Payments Entity Schedule from time to time to reflect changes to the delivery of Payment Services. To the extent Payment Services are provided to you by Paygeon Payments Corporation, the RPC Addendum applies to and governs those Payment Services. For Payment Services that are not provided by Paygeon Payments Corporation, the Payments Addendum applies to and governs those elements of the Payment Services.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>1.15. International Payments<br> 
                                
                                Paygeon may engage one or more Financial Institution Partners to support international payments submitted through the Payment Services (&quot;International Payments&quot;). For International Payments from the U.S. to non-U.S. located payees, Wise US Inc. (&ldquo;International Payments Partner&rdquo;) will provide you with international transfer services pursuant to separate agreement between you and the International Payments Partner set forth at https://wise.com/us/legal/send-money-api. We may provide our International Payments Partner with Company Data and Personal Data to enable the International Payments Partner to satisfy their security and customer due diligence requirements and deliver payments. While the International Payments Partner is your service provider for these International Payments, you may contact Paygeon for support through our standard support channels.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>An International Payment may have associated Fees for which you are responsible. The applicable Fee(s) may vary based on the geographic location of the recipient, the International Payments Partner&rsquo;s fee structure, the payment networks and intermediaries required to fulfill the payment, and other factors. For example, sending US Dollars to a bank account outside the United States via the SWIFT payment network may have an associated transaction Fee. If an International Payment has transaction Fee(s), they will be disclosed in advance of payment submission and provided in a confirmation following payment.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>In connection with an International Payment, you may also have the ability to convert from one currency into another currency at a specified exchange rate. Exchange rates fluctuate so when you submit an International Payment request, you may only receive an initial estimate or range, which will be fixed once the payment is processed. We may include a margin on foreign exchange, which is a platform cost paid by you. A margin is the difference between an exchange rate made available by a Financial Institution Partner and the actual exchange rate used to convert the payment. For International Payments from the U.S. to non-U.S. located payees, if you are an Administrator for a Paygeon Account, you may view current margin(s) applicable to different currencies here.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>2. Payments to Paygeon<br> 
                                
                                2.1. Periodic Card Statements and Other Amounts Owed to Paygeon<br> 
                                
                                You are responsible for payment in full of all Charges, Fees, Fines and other amounts owed by you to Paygeon. You must maintain at least one Linked Account at all times. You represent and warrant that all Linked Accounts belong to you and authorize us to verify that the account details you provide for your Linked Accounts are correct.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>We will provide you Periodic Statements identifying Charges, Fees, Fines, or other amounts charged to your Paygeon Account in connection with Card use, as well as any payments, refunds, Chargebacks granted or other credits to that account. Your Linked Account will be automatically debited for the full amount owed as identified in the Periodic Statement at the end of each billing cycle. Unless otherwise specified in any Notice provided by Paygeon, Periodic Statements will be issued monthly on the day specified in the Services. Your Paygeon Account will show the credit the next day that is not a weekend or bank holiday (&ldquo;Business Day&rdquo;) after payment is received. Paygeon may also debit Linked Accounts for all payments and other amounts owed in connection with the Services or under this Agreement when due.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>All monetary amounts owed under this Agreement will be made in US Dollars (USD), unless otherwise specified by Paygeon through the Services.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>2.2 Set Off and Collections<br> 
                                
                                Charges that are or will be listed on Periodic Statements and any other payments or amounts owed under this Platform Agreement that are not paid on time may be collected from any Linked Account that is currently linked; or set off, debited, or collected from amounts in a Paygeon Account that you hold jointly with a third party or open in the future even if your original Paygeon Account has been closed. This right may be exercised against Company, its affiliates, and any assignees for the benefit of your creditors or receivers. This right will exist even if we do not exercise it prior to the making, filing, or issuance of an arbitration demand, court order, or other action.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Any failure to pay the full amount owed to Paygeon when required is a breach of this Agreement. You are responsible for all costs or expenses that we or Issuers incur collecting amounts owed but not timely paid, including legal or collections fees and any interest at the maximum rate permitted under law.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>2.3. ACH Authorization<br> 
                                
                                THIS SECTION PROVIDES AUTHORIZATION TO AUTOMATICALLY DEBIT YOUR LINKED ACCOUNTS FOR ALL AMOUNTS YOU OWE UNDER THIS PLATFORM AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ IT THOROUGHLY.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>You authorize Paygeon, Financial Institution Partners, and their assigns to collect amounts owed under this Platform Agreement by debiting funds from the Linked Accounts using the Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) network governed by the rules established by the National Automated Clearinghouse Association (NACHA). These debits are bound by NACHA rules for business-related ACH debits. You also authorize us to debit your Linked Accounts for verification purposes (through microdeposits or similar means).</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Paygeon, Financial Institution Partners and their assigns may debit Linked Accounts for all amounts owed to us or such Financial Institution Partner under this Agreement. If we, the applicable Financial Institution Partner or such applicable assign cannot or do not collect these amounts via ACH, you agree to immediately pay all amounts owed as directed. You also authorize Paygeon, Financial Institution Partners, or their assigns to debit Linked Accounts immediately, on any date, and without additional Notice where (a) the total aggregate balance of Linked Accounts is less than any balance minimums that we have communicated to you via the Services or (b) we determine in our sole discretion that the Company poses or may pose an unacceptable risk to Paygeon, Financial Institution Partners, or third parties or no longer satisfies the underwriting criteria used to establish the spending limit for Company.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>To cancel the debit authorization from a Linked Account, you must provide us 30-day advanced notice and pay all amounts owed under your Paygeon Account immediately, including Charges and other amounts that may be included in future Periodic Statements. Such withdrawal of a debit authorization does not terminate the Platform Agreement or your obligation to pay all amounts owed under this Platform Agreement or the Card Terms. Company will be responsible for all costs of collections and damages under this Platform Agreement if amounts owed are not paid by Company as described in this Platform Agreement. Spending limits may be reduced (including to zero), and your Paygeon Account may be terminated or otherwise limited, if you withdraw debit authorization.</p>

                                3.1. Term and Termination<br> 
                                
                                This Platform Agreement is effective when you submit an application for a Paygeon Account and continues until terminated by either you or us, or in accordance with the Card Terms or as otherwise set forth in this Platform Agreement.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>You may terminate this Platform Agreement by paying all amounts owed and providing notice to us but are still responsible for Charges, Fees, Fines, and other amounts owed. Your payment and Paygeon's acceptance of any amounts does not extinguish or waive any of Paygeon's rights hereunder. If you reapply or reopen your Paygeon Account or use or attempt to use the Services or Cards you are consenting to the Platform Agreement in effect at that time. Paygeon may terminate this Platform Agreement, or suspend your Paygeon Account or Cards, by providing you Notice. Upon termination of the Company's Paygeon Account, any related Cards will immediately expire.</p>

                                By submitting your application for a Paygeon Account, you agree that such submission constitutes your electronic signature, and you consent to us providing Notices to you and User Notifications to Users, including in each case those required by law, and you shall ensure that all Users consent to receiving User Notifications, electronically. You understand that this consent has the same legal effect as a physical signature.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Our Notices to you will be effective if provided to an Administrator, and User Notifications will be effective if provided to the applicable User, in each case electronically through the Services, via email, or (except as provided below) via SMS to the contact information provided to us by the Administrators or the User, as applicable; provided that any required Notice of any material change to or amendment of this Agreement under Section 3.12 will be provided to an Administrator.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Notices and User Notifications will be deemed to be received 24 hours after they are sent, provided that Notices or User Notifications captioned or otherwise designated as &quot;URGENT&quot; or &quot;READ IMMEDIATELY&quot; will be deemed to be received when sent. You understand that you may not use the Services or Cards unless you consent to receive Notices and all Users consent to receive User Notifications electronically as provided herein. Consent to receive Notices or User Notifications electronically may be withdrawn only by closing your Paygeon Account.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Notices and User Notifications may include alerts about Services, Cards or Charges and may provide Administrators and Users the ability to respond with information about Charges on Cards or your Paygeon Account. Administrators and Users may elect to not receive certain Notices or User Notifications through the Paygeon Account, but this will limit the use of certain Services and may increase the financial risks to the Company. The Company warrants that it will secure appropriate authorization from Users to send SMS messages to Users on the Company's behalf.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>We will request additional consent to send Administrators and Users SMS messages where required. SMS message frequency varies. Administrators or Users may cancel SMS messaging at any time by texting &quot;STOP&quot; to the short code. After an Administrator or User sends the SMS message &quot;STOP&quot; to us, we will send such Administrator or User an SMS message to confirm that such Administrator or User has been unsubscribed from receiving SMS messages. After this, such Administrator or User will no longer receive SMS messages from us. Such Administrator or User may resume receiving text messages by providing authorization via the Services and we will start sending SMS messages to you or the User again. If you are experiencing issues with the messaging program you can reply to the Paygeon short code with the keyword HELP for more assistance, or you can get help directly at support@Paygeon.com.

                                <p>3.5. Disclaimer of Warranties by Paygeon<br> 
                                
                                THE SERVICES, PAYGEON PROPERTY, AND BETA SERVICES ARE PROVIDED TO YOU AS IS AND AS AVAILABLE. PAYGEON DISCLAIMS ALL EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY WARRANTIES, AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT NO PAYGEON PERSONNEL ARE AUTHORIZED TO PROVIDE ANY SUCH WARRANTY (EXCEPT IN A WRITTEN DOCUMENT IDENTIFIED AS AN AMENDMENT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND EXECUTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF PAYGEON AND AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF CUSTOMER).</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES ARE NOT PROVIDED, CONTROLLED, RECOMMENDED OR ENDORSED BY PAYGEON. PAYGEON DOES NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR AND DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY ARISING FROM FAILURES OR LOSSES CAUSED BY OR RELATING TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.

                                <p>WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, YOU ASSUME ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY FAILURE OF ANY: (A) SERVICES OR DATA PROVIDED UNDER THIS PLATFORM AGREEMENT TO BE ACCURATE AND ERROR-FREE; (B) SERVICES TO MEET YOUR SPECIFIC NEEDS OR REQUIREMENTS; (C) SERVICES TO BE USABLE BY COMPANY, ADMINISTRATORS, OR USERS AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; (D) SPECIFIC MERCHANTS TO PERMIT PURCHASES USING CARDS ISSUED BY A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION PARTNER; (E) SERVICES TO BE UNINTERRUPTED, SECURE, OR FREE FROM HACKING, VIRUSES, OR MALICIOUS CODE; AND (F) ANY DEFECTS IN THE SERVICES TO BE CORRECTED, EVEN WHEN WE ARE ADVISED OF SUCH DEFECTS.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>3.6. Indemnification<br> 
                                
                                You agree to indemnify Paygeon, our affiliates, our and each such affiliate's employees and contractors, and any other Third-Party Service Providers (each an &quot;Indemnitee&quot;) and hold them harmless from and against any losses, liabilities, damages, claims, costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to claims, proceedings, suits, or actions brought by or initiated against Paygeon or any of the other Indemnitees specified above by any third party (i) due to the breach by you or by any Administrator or User of this Platform Agreement, the User Terms, the Card Terms, any terms applicable to any Third-Party Services or any other agreements with Paygeon or any Financial Institution Partner or that otherwise relate to the Services, Cards or Third Party Services; (ii) for amounts owed by Company to third parties; (iii) for acts or omissions of Administrators, Users, or other Company employees or agents; (iv) for Company's use of any Beta Services or Third-Party Services; or (v) for disputes over Charges or other payments between Company and merchants.

                                <p>3.7. Governing Law<br> 
                                
                                This Platform Agreement will be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to contracts entered into and performed in New York by residents thereof, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.8 with respect to the Federal Arbitration Act.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>3.8. Binding Arbitration<br> 
                                
                                PLEASE READ THIS &quot;BINDING ARBITRATION&quot; PROVISION VERY CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND PAYGEON.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>You and Paygeon agree that any and all past, present and future Disputes shall be determined by arbitration, unless your Dispute is subject to an exception to this agreement to arbitrate set forth below. You and Paygeon further agree that any arbitration pursuant to this Section shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action. The award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Paygeon wants to address your concerns without the need for a formal legal dispute. Before filing a claim against Paygeon, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by notice to Paygeon of the actual or potential Dispute. Similarly, Paygeon will provide Notice to you of any actual or potential Dispute to endeavor to resolve any claim we may possess informally before taking any formal action. The party that provides the notice of the actual or potential Dispute (the &quot;Notifying Party&quot;) will include in that notice (a &quot;Notice of Dispute&quot;) the name of Company, the Notifying Party's contact information for any communications relating to such Dispute, and sufficient details regarding such Dispute to enable the other party (the &quot;Notified Party&quot;) to understand the basis of and evaluate the concerns raised. If the Notified Party responds within ten (10) Business Days after receiving the Notice of Dispute that it is ready and willing to engage in good faith discussions in an effort to resolve the Dispute informally, then each party shall promptly participate in such discussions in good faith.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>If, notwithstanding the Notifying Party's compliance with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, a Dispute is not resolved within 30 days after the Notice of Dispute is sent (or if the Notified Party fails to respond to the Notice of Dispute within ten (10) Business Days), the Notifying Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding as described below. If either party purports to initiate arbitration without first providing a Notice of Dispute and otherwise complying with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will promptly dismiss the claim with prejudice and will award the other party all of its costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with such Dispute.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>You and Paygeon both agree to arbitrate. You and Paygeon each agree to resolve any Disputes that are not resolved informally as described above through final and binding arbitration as discussed herein, except as set forth in this Section 3.8.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>You and Paygeon agree that the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) will administer the arbitration under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (the &quot;Rules&quot;). The Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a general Demand for Arbitration.) Arbitration will proceed on an individual basis and will be handled by a sole arbitrator. The single arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within fourteen (14) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules. The arbitrator(s) shall be authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief, that would be available to you in an individual lawsuit, subject to any effective and enforceable limitations of liability or exclusions of remedies set forth herein. Notwithstanding any language to the contrary in this paragraph, if a party seeks injunctive relief that would significantly impact other Paygeon users as reasonably determined by either party, the parties agree that such arbitration will proceed on an individual basis but will be handled by a panel of three (3) arbitrators. Each party shall select one arbitrator, and the two party-selected arbitrators shall select the third, who shall serve as chair of the arbitral panel. That chairperson shall be a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law and with experience arbitrating or mediating disputes. In the event of disagreement as to whether the threshold for a three-arbitrator panel has been met, the sole arbitrator appointed in accordance with this Section shall make that determination. If the arbitrator determines a three-person panel is appropriate, the arbitrator may -- if selected by either party or as the chair by the two party-selected arbitrators -- participate in the arbitral panel. Except as and to the extent otherwise may be required by law, the arbitration proceeding and any award shall be confidential.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>You and Paygeon further agree that the arbitration will be held in the English language in New York, New York, or, if you so elect, all proceedings can be conducted via videoconference, telephonically or via other remote electronic means. Filing costs and administrative fees shall be paid in accordance with the AAA Rules; provided that the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with the arbitration proceeding, in addition to any other relief it may be awarded. This agreement to arbitrate shall be construed under and be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding any other choice of law set out in this Agreement.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>You and Paygeon agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Rules, the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual basis, and neither you nor Paygeon may bring a claim as a part of a class, group, collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a &quot;Collective Arbitration&quot;). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any Dispute against Paygeon will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (i) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more claimants; and (ii) counsel for the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. &quot;Concurrently&quot; for purposes of this provision means that both arbitrations are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR PAYGEON SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE, ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED. Without limiting the foregoing, any challenge to the validity of this paragraph shall be determined exclusively by the arbitrator.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Notwithstanding your and Paygeon's agreement to arbitrate Disputes, You and Paygeon retain the right to bring an individual action in small claims court.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Except as otherwise required by applicable law or provided in this Agreement, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your Dispute, you and Paygeon agree that any judicial proceeding may only be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in New York, New York. Both you and Paygeon irrevocably consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there; provided that either party may bring any action to confirm an arbitral award in any court having jurisdiction.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>This agreement to arbitrate shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. With the exception of the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate that prohibit Collective Arbitration, if a court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of this agreement to arbitrate shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. In the event that a court finds the prohibition of Collective Arbitration to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be deemed void (but no provisions of this Agreement unrelated to arbitration shall be void), and any remaining Dispute must be litigated in court pursuant to the preceding paragraph.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>The existence of and all information regarding any Dispute will be held in strict confidence by the parties and will not be disclosed by either party except as reasonably necessary in connection with the conduct of the arbitration or the confirmation or enforcement of any arbitral award. Any such permitted disclosure will, to the maximum extent reasonably practicable, be made subject to obligations of confidentiality at least as stringent as the provisions of this paragraph. If any disclosure of information regarding any Dispute is required under applicable law, the parties shall reasonably cooperate with one another to obtain protective orders or otherwise to preserve the confidentiality of such information.</p>

                                We may respond to and comply with any legal order we receive related to your use of the Services, including subpoenas, warrants, or liens. We are not responsible to you for any losses you incur due to our response to such legal order. We may take any actions we believe are required of us under legal orders including holding funds or providing information as required by the issuer of the legal order. Where permitted, we will provide you reasonable Notice that we have received such an order.</p>

                                Paygeon may assign, pledge, delegate or otherwise transfer this Platform Agreement or its rights, powers, remedies, obligations, and duties of performance under this Platform Agreement at any time. Any such assignee will have all rights as if originally named in this Platform Agreement instead of Paygeon. You may not assign this Platform Agreement or any rights hereunder, or delegate any of your obligations or duties of performance, without Paygeon's express written consent.</p>

                                Except where otherwise specified, all references to sections or provisions refer to this Platform Agreement or the applicable incorporated terms. The phrases including, for example, or such as do not limit the generality of the preceding provision; the word or will be read to mean either... or... or any combination of the proceeding items; and provisions listing items and using and require all listed items.</p>

                                We may modify this Platform Agreement, including any supplements or addenda, by posting an amended version. The amended version will be effective at the time we post it, unless otherwise noted. If such modifications constitute a material change to the Platform Agreement, we will provide you with reasonable prior Notice before the modifications become effective as to you; provided, however, the modified Platform Agreement may take effect immediately in exigent circumstances, including where required to comply with applicable law, regulation or Payment Network rules or to avoid or mitigate any material risk, loss or damage. If you do not accept any such modification, you must cancel your Paygeon Account. If you provide electronic acceptance of the modifications or continue to use the Services or Cards after any modification takes effect, you will be deemed to have consented to the revised Platform Agreement.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Alternatively, and notwithstanding the foregoing, Paygeon may (but has no obligation to) provide in any such Notice of any modification to this Platform Agreement that such modification will take effect only upon affirmative acceptance thereof by Company via email or another means of communicating such consent as described in such Notice. In that event, Paygeon may terminate your Paygeon Account and any further right to use any Services or Card upon Notice if you do not timely accept the proposed modification in accordance with the method described in the Notice.</p> 
                                
                                  
                                
                                <p>Any waiver, modification, or indulgence that we provide to Company, of any kind or at any time, applies only to the specific instance involved and will not act as a general waiver or a waiver, modification, or indulgence under this Platform Agreement for any other or future acts, events, or conditions.
